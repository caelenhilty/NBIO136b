    4 pA
    I = G(V-E)
    I = (-50 mV+70mV)/(5MOhms) = 0.02V/(5*10**9 Ohms)
      = 0.004 * 10**-9 A = 4 pA

2.1.2(b)
    Increasing noise causes the firing rate to become non-zero before the calculated applied current threshold.
    Higher noise causes the f-I curve to be more erratic, but lower values can smoothe the curve.
    This makes sense because noise allows the neuron to fire at lower applied currents because the noise lets the neuron "jump"
    into sufficient voltage to reach the firing threshold
